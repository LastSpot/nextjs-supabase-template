# Overview

> **⚠️ WARNING:**
> If your project uses a `src` folder, your `middleware.ts` file must be placed inside the `src` folder (e.g., `src/middleware.ts`).
> If you do **not** use a `src` folder, `middleware.ts` must be at the project root (e.g., `middleware.ts`).
> This is required for Next.js to correctly pick up your middleware.

Backflow is a process mapping tool with flow graphs designed for manufacturing cost analysis. It allows users to create visual representations of processes and analyze their costs.

  - Analytics and reporting

# Routes

- `/` - Landing page
- `/login` - User login
- `/signup` - User registration
- `/dashboard` - Main application dashboard (protected)
- `/dashboard/whiteboard/[id]` - Whiteboard editor (to be implemented)

# Database Schema

Current schema in Supabase:

## Users (Managed by Supabase Auth)
- id: UUID (primary key)
- email: String
- password: String (hashed)
- created_at: Timestamp

## Future Tables to Implement

### Whiteboards
- id: UUID (primary key)
- user_id: UUID (foreign key to Users)
- name: String
- description: String
- created_at: Timestamp
- updated_at: Timestamp

### Nodes
- id: UUID (primary key)
- whiteboard_id: UUID (foreign key to Whiteboards)
- type: String
- position_x: Number
- position_y: Number
- data: JSON
- created_at: Timestamp
- updated_at: Timestamp

### Connections
- id: UUID (primary key)
- whiteboard_id: UUID (foreign key to Whiteboards)
- source_id: UUID (foreign key to Nodes)
- target_id: UUID (foreign key to Nodes)
- type: String
- data: JSON
- created_at: Timestamp
- updated_at: Timestamp

# Migration Plans

1. Create Whiteboards table
2. Create Nodes table
3. Create Connections table
4. Add indexes for performance
   - Index on whiteboard_id in Nodes table
   - Index on whiteboard_id in Connections table
   - Index on user_id in Whiteboards table
